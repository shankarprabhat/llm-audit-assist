Text of the Clinical Study Protocol  
1 Background 
The morbidity and mortality of HIV-1-infected patients were significantly reduced after the application of highly 
active antiretroviral therapy to control and prevent HIV replication[1]. Antiretroviral drugs act on three intra-viral 
enzymes (reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase), viral envelope glycoproteins, host cell proteins, and CCR5 
chemokine co-receptors. According to their mechanism of action, there are six different anti-HIV drugs: nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), protease inhibitors (PI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
(NNRTI), fusion inhibitors (FI), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) and co-receptor inhibitors (CI). The 
appropriate combination of these drugs can effectively suppress HIV infection. The principle of combination drug use 
is dependent on the therapeutic efficacy of the combined regimen, the efficacy of the drug used by other patients, 
potential adverse drug reactions, and patient’s adherence to the given regimens[2] . 
The HIV Pol gene encodes three enzymes (with four enzymatic activities): protease, reverse transcriptase (with 
embedded RNAseH), and integrase. HIV replication requires these four enzymes, including protease, reverse 
transcriptase, RNAseH, and integrase. Among them, the reverse transcriptase is an asymmetric heterodimer containing 
the p66 and p51 subunits, both of which are encoded by the same gene sequence in the viral genome, and p51 subunit is 
obtained by cleaving the p66 subunit by viral protease. Both NRTI and NNRTI can inhibit reverse transcriptase. 
Although the chemical composition of the NNRTI class is different, all NNRTIs react with the hydrophobic region 
near the active center of reverse transcriptase to alter the structure of reverse transcriptase and thereby inhibit its activity. 
NNRTI in combination with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t)RTIs) constitute a highly 
effective therapy for treatment naïve individuals living with HIV and have emerged as a treatment option. 
Efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) are the two representative varieties of the NNRTI class, with efavirenz 
being the most prescribed drug. Currently, the most widely used first-line regimen for treatment-naïve patients in China 
is two NRTIs (TDF or AZT + 3TC) plus one NNRTI (EFV or NVP). Among the NNRTI drugs, NVP has a serious 
impact on medication adherence due to adverse effects such as rash and liver toxicity, and its clinical use is also limited 
by the need for introductory monitoring. EFV not only has a low genetic barrier that prone to mutation and drug 
resistance, but also has adverse effects on the central nervous system, and poor drug adherence is the main reason for 
the emergence of drug resistance mutations. In addition, EFV is teratogenic and contraindicated for certain populations. 
With the increasing use of EFV in first-line treatment regimens, many newly infected patients have been detected with

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol

EFV-resistance, and these patients cannot be treated with the regimens containing EFV. Therefore, there is a significant 
clinical need to develop new NNRTI drugs that can effectively suppress EFV-resistant strains and have lower adverse 
effects, which can not only fight against major NNRTI-resistance mutations, but also improve safety and medication 
adherence. 
ACC007 is a novel NNRTI for the treatment of HIV. The compound was originally invented and patented by the 
Korea Institute of Chemical Technology and the preclinical study was completed by Gilead (study code GS9441). In 
2011, Kainos Medicine in Korea acquired the patent license and development rights of the compound and has 
completed a phase I tolerability and pharmacokinetic clinical study in healthy volunteers (KAINOS study code 
KM-023). In 2014, Jiangsu Adi Pharmaceutical Co. obtained the development rights of this variety and patent in China 
from Kainos Medicine (China Patent Authorization Announcement No. CN 101784532 B), and named as ACC007. 
ACC007 is a new NNRTI with favorable safety and pharmacological properties found in preclinical studies, requiring 
only once-daily administration. ACC007 is less likely to have efavirenz-like CNS symptoms and has activity against 
the major efavirenz resistance mutation (K103N). Although its antiviral activity against laboratory-cultured strains and 
clinical isolates of HIV-1 is low, it shows activity in HIV-1 resistant to NRTI, PI, and INSTI, and combined with these 
types of drugs can increase the antiviral activity of ACC007. Moreover, compared to other NNRTIs, ACC007 showed 
lower plasma protein binding and its protein-adjusted antiviral activity was comparable to efavirenz. 
The recommended initial treatment regimens in HIV antiretroviral treatment guidelines issued by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services in 2014 include: NNRTIs-based regimens (2NRTIs + 1NNRTI), PIs-based 
regimens (2NRTIs + 1PI) and INSTIs-based regimens (2NRTIs + 1 INSTI) [3]. The “Consolidated guidelines on the use 
of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection” issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 
2013 recommended the first-line regimens of 2NRTIs + 1NNRTI[4]. Currently, the first-line ART regimens in China are 
two NRTIs (TDF or AZT+ 3TC) plus one NNRTI (EFV or NVP). 
Based on the recommendations of domestic and international treatment guidelines and the long-term and extensive 
clinical evidence base of “2NRTIs + 1NNRTI”, we propose to select ACC007 in combination with (3TC + TDF) for the 
subsequent anti-HIV clinical treatment. ACC007 is not yet on the market, so a drug interaction study of ACC007 in 
combination with 3TC+TDF is required first.

1.2 ACC007 Pharmacodynamic Studies 
ACC007 showed antiviral activity (IC 50) of 5-7 nM against HIV-1 isolates from laboratory cell lines and human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The average EC 50 was 10.4 nM when tested against a group of 20 HIV-1 strains 
representing 10 different subtypes from multiple regions of the world. ACC007 showed no significant decrease in the 
activity of HIV-1 with NRTIs, PIs and INSTIs resistance mutations. And it had synergistic antiviral effects with TFV, 
FTC, 3TC, AZT, ABC, LPV, ATV, RAL and EVG. Compared to other NNRTIs, ACC007 showed lower human serum 
protein binding with a protein-adjusted EC 50 of 23 nM, comparable to EFV (16 nM). ACC007 showed approximately 7 
to 10-fold reduced activity against viral strains containing single RT mutations K103N, Y181C and G190A. In vitro 
resistance selectivity against two wild-type (WT) HIV-1 viral strains, HIV-1 IIIb and NL4-3, in MT-4 cells resulted in 
the emergence of viral libraries containing NNRTI binding site mutations K103N, Y181C, L214F, F227L and V106A, 
F227L, respectively. Both ACC007-selected mutant viral strains showed more than 70-fold reduced susceptibility to 
ACC007 and cross-resistance to EFV. 
In binding assays using the MDS Pharma Lead Profiling Screen and Cerep safety profile screen with over 200 ion 
channels, receptors and enzymes, ACC007 did not bind significantly to any target at a concentration of 10 μM. While 
EFV inhibited ligand binding of many receptors present in the CNS in the Cerep screen. It can be seen that the drug 
off-target effect of ACC007 in the CNS may be relatively low compared to EFV. 
In conclusion, results of several preclinical efficacy studies have shown that ACC007 has low nanomolar activity

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
against HIV-1 laboratory strains and clinical isolates in passaged cell lines and human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells. ACC007 also has activity against HIV-1 containing NRTIs, PIs and INSTs resistance mutations, and ACC007 
showed good synergistic effects in combination with these classes of drugs. These results suggest that ACC007 has 
good promise for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. 
1.3 ACC007 Pharmacology Studies 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted to determine the potential cardiovascular, respiratory and central 
nervous system effects of ACC007. The IC 50 prediction for ACC007 on the hERG potassium channel is greater than the 
upper solubility limit of 50 mM. Therefore, ACC007 may have a negligible risk of arrhythmia in humans due to QT 
interval prolongation. 
The pharmacological effects of ACC007 on the central nervous system were assessed in male mice administered 
orally at single doses of 0, 100, 500 or 1500 mg/kg. No dosing-related effects were observed for any of the qualitative 
or quantitative parameters of the modified Irwin Screen assessment test. Based on these results, the NOEL for ACC007 
in this study was determined to be 1500 mg/kg. 
In a study assessing the pharmacological effects of ACC007 on respiratory, hemodynamic and ECG parameters by 
telemetry after oral administration in beagle dogs, no drug-related effects were found for all parameters at dose levels of 
15, 50 and 150 mg/kg. Based on these results, the NOEL for ACC007 in this study was determined to be 150 mg/kg. 
1.4 ACC007 Toxicology Studies 
The potential acute toxicity of ACC007 was observed in mice by single oral gavage doses of 100, 500, and 1500 
mg/kg/day for 14 days, and the study suggested a no-observed-adverse-effect dose level (NOAEL) of 1500 mg/kg/day 
for ACC007. 
The potential toxicity and toxicokinetics of ACC007 were observed by oral gavage of mice at doses of 100, 500, 
and 1500 mg/kg/day for 28 days, followed by a 28-day recovery period to assess its reversibility, and the study 
suggested a NOAEL of 500 mg/kg/day for ACC007. 
The potential toxicity and toxicokinetics of ACC007 were observed by oral gavage in beagle dogs at doses of 15, 
50, and 150 mg/kg/day for 28 days, followed by a 28-day recovery period to assess its reversibility, and the study 
suggested that the NOAEL of ACC007 was determined to be 150 mg/kg/day. 
There was no evidence of genotoxicity of ACC007 in the in vitro mutation test (Salmonella typhimurium revertant 
mutation test) method according to the guidelines. There was no evidence of genotoxicity of ACC007 in the in vitro

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
induced chromosome damage test (human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test) performed 
according to the guidelines. The genotoxicity of ACC007 was assessed by the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. 
ACC007 did not cause a significant increase in the incidence of young red blood cell micronuclei in the bone marrow at 
a single oral dose of up to 2000 mg/kg, suggesting a negative result in the ACC007 mouse bone marrow micronucleus 
test under the conditions of this study. 
1.5 ACC007 Non-clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies 
We have mainly conducted studies on the blood concentration-time profile, absorption, distribution, excretion, 
binding to plasma proteins, biotransformation, drug metabolizing enzymes and drug interactions of ACC007. 
Preclinical in vivo data in the species indicate that ACC007 has low plasma clearance, a significantly higher 
volume of distribution than the extracellular fluid and good oral bioavailability. Extrapolated human PK data suggest 
that appropriate antiviral concentrations can be achieved with a single daily dose. 
After oral administration of [14 C]-labeled ACC007 to male mice, most of the elimination of radioactivity occurred 
within the first 24 hours, mainly through fecal excretion. Within 168 hours of administration, an average of 59.6% of 
the drug was excreted in the feces and 17.7% in the urine. Radioactivity was widely distributed to mouse tissues 
throughout the body and showed a time-dependent decrease in all tissues tested. the protein binding of ACC007 was 
moderate in mouse, canine and human plasma, and the mean percent unbound of ACC007 in humans was 25.2 ± 1.3%. 
The metabolic transformation of ACC007 is low in mouse, canine and human liver particles, moderate in monkeys 
and high in rats, with monohydroxylation being the major in vitro metabolic pathway of ACC007. 
In vitro studies of human CYP450 isoforms (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4) assays suggest that 
ACC007 may be slowly metabolically converted via CYP2C19. However, the low metabolic conversion rates of all 
isoforms suggest that ACC007 is unlikely to cause significant clinical drug interactions based on metabolic inhibition. 
ACC007 does not significantly inhibit any of the major human CYP450 isoforms at concentrations up to 25 μM. 
ACC007 has no induction of CYP1A and a mild induction of CYP3A4. ACC007 is not a substrate for transporter PGP. 
1.6 ACC007 Completed Clinical Studies

3TC and TDF Clinical Studies and Literature R eview

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
Data from completed clinical studies suggest that, absorption: blood concentrations peak approximately 3 hours 
after oral administration. Diet promotes absorption of ACC007, with an 86.6% increase in C max and 33.7% increase in 
AUC0-t compared to fasting administration and no significant differences between the sexes, while the postprandial 
peak and T 1/2 remain essentially unchanged. Metabolism: In vitro metabolism studies using human hepatocytes showed 
that ACC007 is a weak substrate for cytochrome P450 metabolism and that the major isoenzyme involved in 
metabolism is CYP2C19, which does not induce auto-metabolism. Linearity: The systemic exposure of ACC007 
increases with dose-expanding, but disproportionately increased, with a non-linear pharmacokinetic profile. Excretion: 
The mean renal clearance rate is between 0.11-0.15 L/h, the urinary prototype drug excretion rate is less than 1%, and 
the plasma clearance half-life is approximately 28 hours. 
1.7.1.2 Efavirenz 
The results of pharmacokinetic studies of EFV are as follows. Absorption: Plasma concentrations peak after 
approximately 5 hours of oral administration. Diet promotes the absorption of EFV, and bioavailability increases by 22% 
and 17% after high-fat or normal meals, respectively, compared to fasting administration. Distribution: EFV is highly 
bound to human plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Metabolism: Human studies and in vitro studies with human liver 
microsomes have shown that EFV is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 system to hydroxyl-containing 
metabolites and their further glucosylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially inactive against HIV-1. In vitro 
studies confirmed that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes in the metabolism of EFV. In vitro studies also 
showed that EFV inhibits the P450 isozymes 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4, with weak inhibition at clinically therapeutic doses 
(Ki values are 8.5-17 μM). And EFV did not inhibit CYP2E1, but only inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 at doses well 
above clinical therapeutic doses (Ki values were 82-160 μM). EFV plasma exposure may be increased in patients with 
the G516T genetic variant of the CYP2B6 isozyme purifier. Moreover, EFV has been shown to induce P450 enzymes, 
leading to auto-metabolism. Cumulative drug concentrations at doses of 200 to 400 mg daily for 10 days were lower 
than expected (22 to 42% lower), with an endpoint half-life of 40 to 55 hours, also lower than that of single-dose dosing 
(52 to 76 hours). Elimination: EFV had a relatively long terminal half-life of 52 to 76 hours for single-dose 
administration and 40 to 55 hours after multiple doses. Radiolabeled EFV, about 14 to 34% found in urine, and less 
than 1% of EFV excreted in urine in its original form. 
1.7.1.3 Lamivudine  
The results of pharmacokinetic studies of 3TC are as follows. Absorption: peak blood concentrations were reached

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
after approximately 0.9 ± 0.3 hours of oral administration on an empty stomach. Absolute oral bioavailability was 
86±16% (mean ± SD) in adult patients. Linear pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range. Concomitant 
administration with food resulted in a prolongation of T max and a decrease in C max (by 47%). However, absorption was 
not affected (based on AUC). Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution is approximately 1.3 ± 0.4 L/kg to 
extravascular tissues. The volume of distribution is independent of dose and body weight. 3TC has a low plasma 
protein binding rate (less than 36%). In vitro studies have shown that at concentrations of 0.1-100 μg/mL, the binding 
rate of 3TC to erythrocytes is 53-57%, independent of concentration. Metabolism: Metabolism is a minor route of 
clearance for 3TC, and the only known metabolite is the trans-sulfoxide metabolite. Within 12 hours after a single oral 
dose of 3TC, 5.2 ± 1.4% of the dose was excreted in the urine as a trans-sulfoxide metabolite, which was not measured 
in serum. Excretion: The majority of 3TC is excreted from the urine in its original form by active secretion of organic 
cations. Renal clearance was 199.7 ± 56.9 ml/min (mean ± SD) after a single oral dose of 3TC 300 mg in healthy 
subjects. In most single-dose studies involving HIV-infected patients, HBV-infected patients or healthy subjects, serum 
specimens were collected within 24 hours of administration and a mean elimination half-life of 5-7 h was observed, and 
oral clearance and elimination half-life were independent of dose and body weight at oral doses in the range of 0.25-10 
mg/kg.  
3TC is cleared primarily as a prototype by renal excretion. Drugs that need to be metabolized in vivo have little 
potential to interact with 3TC because of its small hepatic metabolism (5-10%) and low binding to plasma proteins. 
Studies in patients with renal impairment have shown that the clearance of 3TC is affected by renal insufficiency. 
Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance below 20 ml/min. Interaction with meperidine, 
one of the components of cotrimoxazole, increases 3TC exposure by 40% at therapeutic doses. Dose adjustment is not 
required unless the patient has renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment require caution with concomitant use 
of cotrimoxazole and 3TC. 
1.7.1.4 Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 
The results of the TDF pharmacokinetic studies are as follows. Absorption: TDF is a water-soluble, dual-lipid 
precursor drug to the active ingredient tenofovir. The oral bioavailability is approximately 25% on an empty stomach. 
The highest serum concentration (C max) was reached within 1.0±0.4 h after a single oral dose of TDF 300 mg in HIV-1 
infected subjects under fasting conditions. C max and AUC τ values were 249 ng/ml and 2541 ng-hr/ml, respectively. After 
multiple oral administrations of TDF 300 mg on an empty stomach in Chinese healthy subjects, C max and AUC τ values 
were 328 ng/ml and 2460 ng-hr/ml, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir at doses between TDF 75-600 mg

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
were proportional to the dose and were not affected by repeated dosing. Distribution: In the concentration range of 
0.01-25 μg/mL, the in vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma or serum proteins was less than 0.7% and 7.2%, 
respectively. The steady-state volume of distribution was 1.3 ± 0.6 L/kg and 1.2 ± 0.4 L/kg after intravenous 
administration of tenofovir at 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively. Metabolism and clearance: In vitro studies have 
shown that neither TDF nor tenofovir is a substrate for CYP enzymes. The terminal half-life of tenofovir after a single 
oral dose of TDF is approximately 17 h. After multiple oral doses of 300 mg once daily (in the fed state), 32±10% of 
the administered dose is recovered in the urine within 24 h. Tenofovir is cleared by a combination of glomerular 
filtration and active renal tubular secretion. Competition for clearance may arise with other drugs that are cleared 
through the kidney. 
1.7.2 Drug Interaction Studies 
In vitro and animal results showed that no drug-drug interactions occurred between the three components of this 
test drug, ACC007, 3TC, and TDF, and no effects on 3TC pharmacokinetic parameters were seen with TDF in healthy 
volunteers. The results of completed clinical studies of drug interactions with this product indicate a weak interaction 
between ACC007 and (3TC+TDF). 
Because NRTIs are metabolized by different pathways from EFV and are unlikely to compete with EFV for the 
same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways, EFV and (3TC+TDF) are not considered to have clinically 
significant interactions. 
1.7.3 Risks of EFV 
In clinical controlled studies in combination with PIs and/or NRTIs, the most common adverse events of moderate 
to severe severity occurring at an incidence greater than 5% and related to treatment were rash (11.6%), dizziness 
(8.0%), nausea (8.0%), headache (5.7%), and malaise (5.5%). The most notable adverse events associated with EFV 
were rash, neurologic symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms. Concomitant administration with food increases EFV 
exposure and can increase the incidence of adverse reactions. Elevations in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine 
aminotransferase, and glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were observed in some laboratory tests performed in clinical 
studies in some patients receiving EFV. However, the separate GGT elevations in EFV-treated patients respond to 
enzyme induction rather than hepatotoxicity. Elevated lipids have also been observed in some clinical studies in 
patients taking EFV. Other treatment-related adverse events that have occurred less frequently in clinical studies include: 
allergic reactions, coordination abnormalities, ataxia, confusion, coma, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, hepatitis, 
inattention, insomnia, anxiety, heterodreams, sleepiness, depression, abnormal thinking, euphoria, amnesia, confusion,

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
emotional instability, euphoria, hallucinations, and psychotic symptoms. In addition, some of the adverse events 
reported in post-marketing surveillance include: neurasthenia, paranoia, cerebellar coordination and balance disorders, 
convulsions, pruritus, abdominal pain, blurred vision, flushing, gynecomastia, hepatic failure, photosensitivity 
dermatitis, pancreatitis and redistribution or accumulation of body fat at the back of the neck, breast, abdomen and 
retroperitoneum, tinnitus and tremors. 
1.7.4 Risks of 3TC 
The following adverse events have been reported in HIV-1-infected patients treated with 3TC. The adverse events 
potentially associated with treatment are listed separately according to body system, organ class, and incidence, etc. 
The conventional expressions for the classification of adverse reactions are: very common (>10%), common (1-10%), 
rare (0.1-1%), and very rare (<0.01%). 
Hematologic and lymphatic system symptoms: neutropenia, anemia (both of which are sometimes severe), 
thrombocytopenia are rare, and pure red blood cell aplasia is extremely rare; neurologic symptoms include headache, 
insomnia, and very rarely peripheral neuropathy or sensory abnormalities; respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal 
symptoms include cough and nasal symptoms; gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain or 
abdominal pain, diarrhea, elevated serum amylase, pancreatitis is rare; liver manifestations: rare symptoms are transient 
elevation of liver enzymes (AST, ALT), and hepatitis is extremely rare; skin and subcutaneous tissue common 
symptoms are rash, hair loss; musculoskeletal and joint tissue common arthralgia, muscle dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis 
is rare; other common symptoms are fatigue, discomfort, fever. 
Cases of lactic acidosis usually with severe hepatomegaly and fatty liver have been reported in patients on 
nucleoside analogs, sometimes with life-threatening effects. HIV-1 patients treated with combination antiretroviral 
drugs can be associated with redistribution of body fat (impaired fat metabolism), including peripheral and facial 
subcutaneous fat loss, increased abdominal and visceral fat, breast enlargement, and neck and back fat accumulation. 
Combination antiretroviral therapy may be associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridemia, 
hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, and hyperlactatemia. 
1.7.5 Risks of TDF 
In clinical trials with TDF tablets alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs in adults with HIV-1 
infection, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, grades 2-4) included rash, 
diarrhea, headache, pain, depression, malaise, and nausea. In clinical trials of TDF tablets or stavudine in combination 
with 3TC and EFV in ART-naïve patients, and in clinical trials of TDF + emtricitabine in combination with EFV or

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
zidovudine/3TC in combination with EFV in ART-naïve subjects as well as ART-experienced subjects, the most 
common adverse reactions were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events and dizziness. In clinical trials in adult 
subjects with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease, a higher number of injured subjects experienced 
nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, malaise, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and rash. In clinical trials in 
Chinese adults with chronic hepatitis B, the most frequently reported adverse event was upper respiratory tract infection. 
In clinical trials in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease, the most common adverse 
reactions were abdominal pain, nausea, insomnia, pruritus, vomiting, dizziness and fever. The following adverse 
reactions were identified during post-approval use of TDF: (1) immune system disorders: allergic reactions, including 
neuroedema; (2) metabolic and nutritional disorders: hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, lactic acidosis; (3) respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea; (4) gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain, elevated amylase and 
pancreatitis; (5) hepatobiliary disorders: fatty liver, elevated liver enzymes (most commonly glutamic aminotransferase, 
ghrelin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), hepatitis; (6) skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash; (7) 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: rhabdomyolysis, osteochondrosis (manifested by bone pain, which 
may cause fractures), myasthenia gravis, myopathy; (8) renal and urinary disorders: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
acute renal failure, Fanconi syndrome ( renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), proximal tubular lesions, 
proteinuria, elevated creatinine, acute tubular necrosis, nephrogenic uremia, polyuria and interstitial nephritis (including 
acute cases); (9) systemic diseases and medication site conditions: weakness.

3 Study Design and Methodology 
3.1 Overall Design 
Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-simulation, positive parallel-controlled, non-inferiority trial design. 
3.2 Sample Size Calculation 
According to the literature reports and the current situation of antiviral treatment in China, the average percentage 
of subjects with HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL after treatment was expected to be 80% for the experimental group 
and the control group in this study. The significance level of the test is at a 1-sided, α=0.025, β=0.2, and a 
non-inferiority threshold is 0.10[3]. Based on the above parameters and a ratio of 1:1 to experimental group and control 
group, the sample size was calculated to be 252 for each group. After considering the shedding rate of about 20%, the 
final sample size was calculated to be 630 (315 per group). 
3.3 Dose Selection 
The results of the completed phase IIa clinical study showed that ACC007 at 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg doses 
significantly inhibited HIV RNA in infected patients with high or low level of viral loads, with mean viral load 
decreases of 1.73 log10, 1.72 log10, and 1.66 log10, respectively, and all showed good safety. In view of the results of 
the ACC007 MAD study showing that its exposure is not linear with the increase in dose, in addition, the 150 mg dose 
has reached the expected C24 concentration requirements, while the 75 mg dose cannot meet the serum 
protein-adjusted EC50 (nM) of the K103N/Y181C drug-resistant strain in vitro experiments. Combined with the 
consideration of the genetic instability of HIV and a combination of drugs with higher exposure concentrations was 
usually used to prevent the occurrence of drug resistance mutations, the dose of ACC007 administered in this study was 
therefore determined to be 150 mg per person, once a day. 
EFV, 3TC, and TDF have all been on the market for many years and have accumulated a large amount of

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol

5.4 Drug Allocation and Randomization 
The trial was centrally randomized, stratified by center, and random numbers were assigned by DAS for IWRS. 
Randomization of blinded personnel was performed on a computer using SAS 9.4 statistical software package, and 
random numbers were generated in a 1:1 ratio between the experimental and control groups using the central zone 
group randomization method. The randomization numbers were imported into the DAS for IWRS system for requesting 
randomization numbers and issuing drugs, and each center competed for enrollment. 3TC and TDF were required to 
keep detailed records of drug allocation and recall. The randomization form (primary blinded base) and secondary 
blinded base were kept in sealed triplicate and sealed at the sponsor, clinical study agency in charge and DSMB, 
respectively.

6.3 Efficacy Indicators and Quality Control of Central Laboratory Tests 
6.3.1 Detection of HIV viral load  
Whole blood collected in accordance with the “SOP for Specimen Collection, Preparation, and Cryopreservation” 
during the screening period and at 12 and 24 weeks of the study will be separated and prepared for plasma, and will be 
tested by each research center. The test results at the screening period will be used as the inclusion criteria for subjects, 
and the test results at 24 weeks will be used as the reference standard for assessing virological failure. 
From the beginning of the baseline to the end of the study, each blood collection time should collect 10 mL of 
whole blood from the subjects according to the SOP of Specimen Collection, Preparation, Freezing and Transfer, and 
the plasma after separation and preparation should be divided into lyophilization boxes and stored in the refrigerator at 
-80°C. The lyophilization boxes should be marked with the project name, lyophilization box number, and the range of 
the sample corresponding to the random number. The top view of the specimen in the lyophilization box should be 
filled in to find the specimen, and the collected specimens should be transferred to the central laboratory. The transfer 
and testing of viral load specimens (HIV RNA Abbott) in the central laboratory should be performed in full compliance 
with the SOP for transfer and testing of specimens to strictly control possible bias in this major efficacy index. 
6.3.2  Detection of CD4 
In -30d~-1d, -7d~1d, the CD4 cell count should be checked once each, and a total of two tests will be performed, 
and the last test result will be used as the baseline value of CD4. Testing is required at each study center at each visit 
time from 4 weeks to the end of the study. 
6.3.3 Detection of PPK 
At 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks of the study, each blood collection time should collect 4.5 mL of whole blood 
according to the SOP for PPK specimen collection, preparation, freezing and transfer, and the plasma after separation 
and preparation should be stored in 3 portions in lyophilization boxes at -80°C in the refrigerator until the analysis test, 
and avoid repeated freezing and thawing. The specimens collected should be transferred to the pharmacogenetic

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
specimen testing agency. The transfer and testing of PPK specimens by the pharmacogenetic specimen testing agency 
should be carried out in full compliance with the SOP for the transfer and testing of specimens in the central laboratory 
in order to strictly control the possible bias of this major efficacy index. 
6.3.4 Genotypic drug resistance testing 
At baseline and at 24 weeks, 48 weeks and 96 weeks of treatment, each blood collection time should collect 10 mL 
of whole blood according to the SOP for collection, preparation, preservation and transfer of genotypic drug resistance 
test specimens. After separation and preparation, the plasma should be stored in 3 portions in a lyophilization box at 
-80°C until analysis and testing when necessary. The top view of the specimen in the lyophilization cassette can be used 
to locate the specimen. 
6.4 Efficacy Assessment  
6.4.1 Primary endpoint indicators 
z Percentage of subjects with HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks of treatment (RT-PCR 
method), evaluated by Snapshot Approach[4]. 
6.4.2 Secondary endpoint indicators 
z Changes in HIV RNA log values at 48 and 96 weeks of treatment 
z Percentage of HIV RNA levels ≤400 copies/mL at 48 and 96 weeks of treatment 
z Percentage of subjects with HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL at 96 weeks of treatment 
z Changes in CD4 cell counts at 48 and 96 weeks of treatment 
6.5 Safety Assessment 
6.5.1 Clinical Safety Assessment 
Subjects’ spontaneous reports or direct physician observation or non-induced questioning of subjects about adverse 
events will be collected during the clinical trial and evaluated at 24, 48 and 96 weeks of treatment. 
6.5.2 Laboratory Safety Assessment 
The changes of routine blood test, routine urine test, blood biochemistry and electrocardiogram at 24, 48 and 96 
weeks will be compared, and urine pregnancy test (only for women of childbearing age), abdominal ultrasound and 
chest X-ray will be performed during the clinical trial to evaluate their safety. 
6.6 PK/PD (PK/HIV RNA, PK/AE) Assessment 
According to the population pharmacokinetic method, the analysis of drug PK/PD and PK/AE relationships will be

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
performed by sparse sampling to obtain blood concentrations with the main efficacy and safety indicators. 
6.7 Medication Adherence Assessment 
Adherence assessment (%) = actual number of medications/theoretical number of medications × 100%. 
Medication adherence assessment: ACC007 or EFV and (3TC + TDF) will be calculated separately for 
compliance. 
This study required medication adherence of ≥90% and ≤110%.  
7 Drug Safety Management 
7.1 Develop a Drug Safety Management Plan 
The drug safety vigilance department of the sponsor or its delegated institution will develop a drug safety 
management plan based on GCP-related principles and clinical trial-related content (e.g., protocols, investigator 
manuals, literature, etc.) that will document, describe, and define the various tasks of drug safety management as a 
guide to the entire drug safety management process. The drug safety management plan should include: communication 
plan, drug safety management time plan, drug safety management process, report review, and document maintenance. 
7.2 Adverse Events 
7.2.1 Definition of adverse event 
An adverse medical event that occurs after a subject receives a drug, but is not necessarily causally related to 
treatment. Adverse events include, but are not limited to: 
z Abnormal laboratory test results. 
z Clinically significant signs and symptoms. 
z Changes in physical examination results. 
z Allergies. 
z Progression/exacerbation of pre-existing disease. 
In addition, adverse events include signs or symptoms resulting from: 
z Drug overdose. 
z Discontinuation of medication. 
z Drug abuse. 
z Drug misuse. 
z Drug-drug interactions.

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
z Drug dependence. 
7.2.2 Abnormal laboratory test results 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective finding should be reported as an adverse event are as 
follows: 
z The test result correlates with concomitant symptoms, and/or 
z The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or therapeutic measures/surgical intervention, 
and/or 
z The test results lead to a change in the subject’s drug dose or discontinuation of the trial, the need for 
additional concomitant medication, or other treatment, and/or 
z The investigator or sponsor judged that the test result should be reported as an adverse event. 
If it is only to repeat the examination of an abnormality, but does not meet any of the above conditions, it will not 
be judged as an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is judged to be an error is not required to be reported as an 
adverse event. 
7.2.3 Observation of adverse event 
All observed or spontaneously reported adverse events must be tracked by investigators with sufficient 
information to determine the consequences of the adverse events and assess whether they meet the criteria for serious 
adverse events and require immediate reporting to appropriate personnel and departments. 
For all adverse events, the investigator should also obtain sufficient information to clarify the cause of the adverse 
event and to make an assessment of the cause of the adverse events. If the investigator believes that there is a causal 
relationship between the trial drug and the adverse event, the adverse event must be followed until the adverse event or 
its sequelae have resolved or stabilized at a level that the investigator considers acceptable. 
7.2.4 Reporting period 
From the time after the subject’s first dose of the trial drug until the last follow-up visit, the investigator shall 
report all directly observed adverse events as well as subject voluntarily reported adverse events. In addition, each 
subject will be asked questions about the adverse event. 
All adverse events should be recorded on the adverse event page of the case report form, with adverse event 
terminology and accurate medical terminology, and coded according to the MedDRA Code system. 
7.2.5 Adverse event severity assessment 
The investigators graded the adverse events according to the DAIDS AE grading scale (if an adverse event

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
occurred that is not covered by the DAIDS AE grading scale, please refer to CTCAE v5.0) into grades 1 to 5, where 
grade 1 corresponds to mild, grade 2 corresponds to moderate, grade 3 corresponds to severe, grade 4 corresponds to 
potentially life-threatening, and grade 5 corresponds to death. 
A distinction should be made between the severity and seriousness of the adverse event, and a severe adverse 
event may not be a serious adverse event. 
7.2.6 Evaluation of the relationship between adverse events and trial drugs 
The investigator must make an assessment of the cause of all adverse events (serious and non-serious). This 
assessment is the investigator’s judgment of the likelihood that the test drug caused or was involved in causing the 
adverse event. If the investigator is uncertain about the cause of the adverse event and does not know whether it was 
caused by the trial drug, the event should be classified as “related to the trial drug”. If the investigator’s assessment is 
“unknown cause but not related to the trial drug”, the event should be clearly documented in the trial record. 
The relationship between clinical reactions and laboratory abnormalities and test drugs will be evaluated according 
to the following five levels, the first three were counted as adverse reactions, and the incidence of adverse reactions 
should be counted. 
Definitely related  
The reaction occurs in a reasonable chronological order of administration, is consistent with the type of reaction 
known for the suspected drug, disappears after discontinuation of the suspected drug, and the subject’s clinical status or 
other reasons are unlikely to produce the reaction. 
Likely related 
The reaction occurs in a reasonable chronological order of administration, is consistent with the type of reaction 
known for the suspected drug, is significantly reduced after discontinuation of the suspected drug, and the subject’s 
clinical status or other reasons are unlikely to produce the reaction. 
Possibly related 
The reaction occurs in a reasonable chronological order of administration, is consistent with the type of reaction 
known for the suspected drug, and can be alleviated after stopping the suspected drug, but the subject’s clinical status or 
other reasons may also produce the reaction. 
Possibly unrelated 
The reaction does not appear in a reasonable chronological order after administration, does not correspond well to 
the type of reaction known for the suspected drug, does not alleviate after discontinuation of the suspected drug, the

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
subject’s clinical state or other causes may have produced the reaction, and the reaction is alleviated after improvement 
of the disease state or elimination of other causes. 
Definitely not related 
The reaction does not occur in a reasonable time sequence after administration, does not correspond to the type of 
reaction known for the suspected drug, the subject’s clinical state or other causes can produce the reaction, and the 
reaction is reduced after the disease state improves or other causes are eliminated. 
7.3 Serious Adverse Events 
7.3.1 Definition of serious adverse event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event is any undesired medical event that occurs at any dose, including: 
z Results in death. 
z Is life-threatening (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event). 
z Requires inpatient hospitalization (other than hospitalization due to social factors) or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization. 
z Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
z Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
z Other important medical events: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. 
These events should usually be considered serious. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is a medically significant 
event. An important medical event, although not necessarily immediately life-threatening and/or resulting in death or 
hospitalization, should be reported as a serious adverse event if it is determined to be potentially harmful to the subject 
and requires medical intervention to prevent the occurrence of any of the consequences in the definition of serious 
adverse event above. 
7.3.2 Serious adverse event reporting 
If a serious adverse event occurs during the trial, regardless of whether it is related to the trial treatment, 
appropriate treatment measures must be taken immediately, along with reporting by telephone, faxing the serious 
adverse event report form to the principal investigator within 24 hours of being informed.

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
If a serious adverse event occurs, the investigator should report the event to the sponsor, the drug clinical trial 
institution and ethics committee of the study center, the State Administration of Market Administration (formerly 
CFDA), the provincial Food and Drug Administration, the National Health and Family Planning Commission, the 
DSMB, and the pharmacovigilance department of the sponsor or its delegated institution within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event, and the investigator must sign and date the report.  
If a serious adverse event occurs that is fatal or life-threatening, the appropriate personnel and departments should 
be notified immediately, regardless of how much information on this adverse event has been obtained. This time limit 
also applies to additional information about a previously reported serious adverse event. If the investigator is unable to 
learn of the serious adverse event in a timely manner (e.g., if the patient is seen in an outside hospital), but should 
report and document when he/she first learned of the adverse event within 24 hours of becoming aware of it. 
For all serious adverse events, it is the responsibility of the investigator to track and provide information to the 
appropriate personnel and departments in accordance with the reporting timelines specified above. This information 
should be more detailed than the information recorded on the adverse event report form. Typically, a detailed 
description of the adverse event should be included so that a complete medical assessment of the event can be made and 
an independent determination of the probable cause can be made. In addition, information on other possible causes, 
such as concomitant medications and concomitant diseases, must also be provided. In the case of death of a subject, the 
autopsy report, if available, must be forwarded to the appropriate personnel and authorities as soon as possible. 
The drug safety alert department of the sponsor or its delegated agency shall report the serious adverse event 
report to the State Administration of Market Supervision (formerly CFDA), the National Health and Family Planning 
Commission, the Provincial Food and Drug Administration, and the Provincial Health and Family Planning 
Commission within the 7-day (death or life-threatening SAE)/15-day (other SAE) period after receipt of the serious 
adverse event report form. 
Each serious adverse event reported by the investigator during the clinical trial is to be reviewed by the sponsor’s 
pharmacovigilance staff in a timely manner to determine if it is a suspected and unexpected serious adverse reaction 
(SUSAR). If a SUSAR is judged to be a fatal/life-threatening event, it will be sent to the pharmacovigilance department 
of the sponsor 2 business days prior to the reporting deadline (7 calendar days), and the remaining SUSARs will be sent 
to the pharmacovigilance department of the sponsor 2 business days prior to the reporting deadline (15 calendar days), 
in accordance with ICH “E2B(R3): Management of Clinical Safety Data: Transmission of Individual Safety Reports”, 
and the relevant terms should be coded using the ICH “M1: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)”.

SUSAR does not include: 
（1）Non-serious adverse events. 
（2）Serious adverse event determination may or may not be related to the trial drug ACC007. 
（3）Serious but expected adverse reactions. 
（4）Should remain blind as much as possible, but in the broken blind state, can be judged as definitely related, 
likely related or possibly related to EFV, 3TC, TDF, and meet the expected adverse reactions of EFV, 3TC and TDF. 
（5）AIDS and AIDS-related complications. 
The CRA is responsible for properly recording and maintaining all SAEs, regularly verifying and updating them, 
and communicating with the investigators to urge them to follow up the SAEs on time. The CRC enters the SAEs and 
report tracking data into the EDC system in a timely manner, and the data management agency regularly summarizes 
and reports them to the sponsor, who sends them to the CRA for uniform reporting to the investigators, drug clinical 
trial institutions and ethics committees of each participating center.

them in a timely manner. 
z Audit: The sponsor will designate a person to conduct an audit at each research center. 
z Inspection: The State Administration of Market Supervision and Administration may conduct 
inspection of this test. 
8.2 Identification of Subjects  
All screened subjects will be registered by number. 
8.3 Retention of Original Records 
According to GCP requirements, the study centers should retain all subject information for a period of 5 years after 
the trial is fully completed. If the trial drug is approved for marketing, the retention period is 5 years after the trial drug 
is approved for marketing. 
8.4 Internal Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
To ensure compliance with the requirements of this trial protocol and the GCP, the sponsor will commission the 
CRO monitor to conduct screening, enrollment sites, and periodic monitoring visits during the course of the trial. The 
investigators and research institutions should allow direct access to the original documents by the monitors and 
inspectors to complete the verification. 
The IEC and/or the sponsor’s quality assurance auditors may verify the raw data. 
The investigator and relevant personnel should be involved throughout the monitoring visits, possible audits and 
inspections. 
In addition, the internal quality control officer of the research agency will conduct occasional random checks on 
the whole process and data information of this test to ensure that this trial is conducted in strict accordance with the trial 
protocol. 
9 Data Management  
9.1 Develop a Data Management Plan 
The data manager develops a data management plan based on GCP-related principles and clinical trial-related 
elements (e.g., plan, CRF draft, actual situation of the project, etc.). The data management plan will document, describe 
and define the data management tasks to guide the entire data management process. The data management plan should 
include: data management process, eCRF design, data entry and challenge management, external data management,

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
database locking, document retention, etc. 
9.2 eCRF Design 
The eCRF design will be carried out according to the research proposal. After the eCRF design is completed, a 
system test is required. The eCRF after the test is completed and approved by the sponsor will be put into operation. 
9.3 Data Entry 
The eCRF data are obtained from the original records and are entered into the EDC by the investigator or 
authorized personnel in a timely manner according to the instructions for completing the eCRF to ensure that the data 
are true, accurate, complete, and timely, and that they are consistent with the data in the subject’s original medical 
record. The investigator’s EDC user name and password are for the exclusive use of the investigator and should not be 
disclosed, and should not be used by others to enter data on behalf of the investigator. 
9.4 User Management 
All users accessing the EDC are required to fill out a user account application form, and after the PM confirms 
approval, the project administrator user application form creates the roles of investigator, research assistant (CRC), etc. 
and grants different permissions to access the EDC. e.g., investigators in each center can only see the content of their 
own center and have the right to revise data, and sponsors are limited to browsing the EDC; monitors can read the EDC 
data in each center and have no data revision The supervisor can read the EDC data of each center without data revision 
rights, but can issue questions. 
All users who access EDC need to fill in the account application form. After confirmation and approval by PM, the 
project administrator will create roles such as researcher and research assistant (CRC) and grant different permissions 
to access EDC. Among them, the researchers of each center can only see the content of their own center and have the 
right to revise the data. The sponsor is limited to browsing the EDC. The monitor can read the EDC data of each center 
and ask questions, but has no data revision authority. 
9.5 Data Verification 
On-site verification of source data: The supervisor performs consistency checks between eCRF data and source 
data, and can send questions if there are problems. 
Data verification plan: The data manager develops the verification plan based on the program and eCRF. Online 
verification program is configured according to the data verification plan, and data queries are automatically generated 
by the system, while queries can also be sent manually during manual data checking.

ADYY-ACC007-301 Clinical Study Protocol 
 
Version number: V2.0 Version date: 20181023 
  
Data questions and answers: Questions come from system questions of EDC logic verification, and manual 
questions such as auditors and data administrators, which need to be answered by researchers in a timely manner. Data 
administrators and monitors close the queries and can reissue them if necessary until the data is “clean”. 
9.6 Electronic Signature 
After data entry is completed and no data doubts after on-site verification of source data, the investigator conducts 
electronic signature review and confirmation. If there are data revisions after the signature, a new signature is required. 
9.7 Database Locking 
After the database lock record is signed by the principal investigator, sponsor, statistical analyst and data manager, 
the data manager performs the database locking. 
9.8 Data Management File Retention and Data Transfer 
The project data manager shall maintain data management related documents as required and transfer the locked 
database to the statistical analyst for statistical analysis. 
10 Statistical Analysis 
10.1 Hypothesis Testing 
H0 (null hypothesis): P1-P2 ≤ -0.1, H1 (alternative hypothesis): P1-P2 > -0.1 
P1 is the viral load suppression rate in the experimental group, and P2 is the viral load suppression rate in the 
control group. Viral load suppression rate is that the proportion of subjects achieving HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL. 
10.2 Analysis Sets 
Full analysis set (FAS): a collection of all subjects who are randomized into the study and have received at least 
one dose of study drug. When the primary efficacy indicators are missing, the previous result will be carried forward 
according to the intentional analysis. Secondary efficacy indicators were will be according to the actual data in the FAS. 
Per-protocol analysis set (PPS): a data set generated from subjects who are fully compliant with the trial protocol. 
Adherence includes treatment received, availability of index measurements for the primary endpoint, and no major 
violations of the trial protocol. The PPS will be used for the primary efficacy analyses. 
Safety data set (SS): received at least one treatment and have the actual data recorded by the safety index after 
treatment. The incidence of adverse reactions will be used as the denominator for the number of SS cases.

non-inferiority criterion of 10%. According to the Snapshot Approach recommended by FDA, HIV RNA 
missing data during the window period will be treated as no virological response and considered as HIV RNA ≥ 
50 copies/mL. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy indicators: 
z The difference between the log value of HIV RNA after 48 weeks of treatment and the baseline value will 
be analyzed by covariance analysis (ANCOVA) with the group as a fixed effect and the baseline value as a 
covariate. PPS and FAS analyses will be performed at the same time. 
z The percentage of subjects with HIV RNA ≤ 400 copies/mL after 48 weeks of treatment will be also 
analyzed by PPS and FAS. With baseline HIV RNA <100000 copies/mL and ≥100000 copies/mL as
