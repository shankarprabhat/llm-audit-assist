Guideline for good clinical practic e E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 6/68 
 
 Introduction  
Good Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  is an international  ethical  and scientific  quality standard for designing, 
conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance 
with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and well -being of trial subjects are 
protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that 
the cl inical trial data are credible.  
The objective of this ICH GCP Guideline is to provide a unified standard for the European  Union  (EU), 
Japan  and the United  States  to facilitate  the mutual acceptance of clinical data by the regulatory 
authorities in these jurisdictions.  
The guideline was developed with consideration of the current good clinical practices of the European 
Union, Japan, and the United States, as well as tho se of Australia, Canada, the Nordic countries and 
the W orld Health Organization (WHO).  
This guideline should be followed when generating clinical trial data that are intended to be submitted 
to regulatory authorities.  
The principles established in this gui deline may also be applied to other clinical investigations that may 
have an impact on the safety and well -being of human subjects.  
ADDENDUM  
Since the development of the ICH GCP Guideline, the scale, c omplexity, and cost of clinical trials have 
increased. Evolutions in technology and risk management processes offer new  opportunities to 
increase efficiency and focus on relevant activities. When the original ICH  E6(R1) text was prepared, 
clinical trials were performed in a largely paper -based process.  Advance s in use of electronic data 
recording and reporting facilitate implementation of other  approaches. For example, centralized 
monitoring can now offer a greater advantage, to a  broader range of trials than is suggested in the 
original text. Therefore, this g uideline has  been amended to encourage implementation of improved 
and more efficient approaches to  clinical trial design, conduct, oversight, recording and reporting while 
continuing to ensure  human subject protection and reliability of trial results. Stan dards regarding 
electronic  records and essential documents intended to increase clinical trial quality and efficiency have  
also been updated.  
This guideline should be read in conjunction with other  ICH guidelines relevant to the conduct of 
clinical trials (e.g., E2A (clinical safety data management), E3 (clinical study  reporting), E7 (geriatric 
populations), E8 (general considerations for clinical trials), E9  (statistical principles), and E11 (pediatric 
populations)).  
This ICH GCP Guideline Integrated Adden dum provides a unified standard for the Euro pean Union, 
Japan, the United States, Canada, and Switzerland to facilitate the mutual acceptance  of data from 
clinical trials by the regulatory authorities in these jurisdictions. In the event of  any conflict be tween 
the E6(R1) text and the E6(R2) addendum text, the E6(R2) addendum  text should take priority.

 1.  Glossary  
1.1.  Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, particularly as 
the therapeuti c dose(s) may not be established: all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal 
product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. The phrase responses to a 
medicinal product means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event 
is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the re lationship cannot be ruled out.  
Regarding marketed medicinal products: a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and 
which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases or for 
modification of physiological function (see the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting).  
1.2.  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnor mal 
laboratory finding), symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (see the 
ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definiti ons and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting).

(GCP), and the ap plicable regulatory requirements.  
1.6.  Audit  
A systematic and independent examination of trial related activities and documents to determine 
whether the evaluated trial related activities were conducted, and the data were recorded, analyzed 
and accurately repor ted according to the protocol, sponsor's standard operating procedures (SOPs), 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
1.7.  Audit c ertificate

reactions to an investigational product(s), and/or to study absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion of an investigational product(s) with the object of ascertaining its safety and/or efficacy. The 
terms clinical trial and clinical study are synonymous.  
1.13.  Clinical trial/study r eport  
A written description of a trial/study of any therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagn ostic agent conducted in 
human subjects, in which the clinical and statistical description, presentations, and analyses are fully

Reports).  
1.14.  Comparator (Produ ct) 
An investigational or marketed product (i.e., active control), or placebo, used as a reference in a 
clinical trial.  
1.15.  Compliance (in relation to trials)

2.1.   
Clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with the et hical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that are consistent with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
2.2.   
Before a  trial is  initiated, foreseeable risks and inconveniences should be weighed against the 
anticipa ted benefit for the individual trial subject and society.  A trial should  be initiated  and continued  
only if the anticipated benefits justify the risks.  
2.3.   
The rights, safety, and well -being of the trial subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.  
2.4.   
The available nonclinical and clinical information on an investigational  product should be adequate to 
support the proposed clinical trial.  
2.5.   
Clinical trials should be scientifically sound, and described in  a clear, detailed protocol.  
2.6.   
A trial should be conducted in compliance with the protocol that has received prior institutional review 
board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) approval/favourable opinion.  
2.7.   
The medical care given to, and medical decis ions made on behalf of, subjects should always be the 
responsibility of a qualified physician or, when appropriate, of a qualified dentist.  
2.8.   
Each individual  involved  in conducting  a trial should  be qualified  by education, training, and experience 
to perfor m his or her respective task(s).  
2.9.   
Freely given informed consent should be obtained from every subject prior to clinical trial participation.

Guideline for good clinical practi ce E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 16/68 
 
 2.10.   
All clinical trial information should be recorded, handled, and stored in a way that allows its accurate 
reporting , interpretation and verification.   
ADDENDUM  
This principle applies to all records referenced in this guid eline, irrespective of the type of media used.  
2.11.   
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects should be protected, respecting the privac y 
and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
2.12.   
Investigational  products  should  be manufactured,  handled,  and stored  in accordance with applicable 
good manufacturing practice (GMP). They should be used in accordanc e with the approved protocol.  
2.13.   
Systems with procedures that assure the quality of every aspect of the trial should be implemented.  
ADDENDUM  
Aspects of the trial that are essential to ensure human subjec t protection and reliability of trial results 
should b e the focus of such systems.  
3.  Institutional Review Board / Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC)

representative is not possible (see 4.8.15), the IRB/IEC should determine that the proposed protocol 
and/or other document(s) adequately  addresses   relevant   ethical   concerns   and  meets   applicable 
regulator y requirements for such trials (i.e. in emergency situations).  
3.1.8.   
The IRB/IEC  should  review  both the amount  and method  of payment  to subjects  to assure  that neither  
presents  problems  of coercion  or undue influence on the trial subjects. Payments to a subject  should 
be prorated and not wholly contingent on completion of the trial by the subject.  
3.1.9.   
The IRB/IEC should ensure that information regarding payment to subjects, including the methods, 
amounts, and schedule of payment to trial subjects, is set forth in t he written informed consent form 
and any other written information to be provided to subjects. The way payment will be prorated should 
be specified.

k) The antic ipated prorated payment, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial.  
l) The anticipated expenses, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial.  
m) That the  subject's participation in  the trial is  voluntary and that the subject may refuse to 
participate or withdraw from the trial, at any time, without  penalty  or loss of benefits  to which  the 
subject  is otherwise entitled.  
n) That the monitor(s), the auditor(s), the IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authority(ies) will be granted 
direct access to the sub ject's original medical records for verification of clinical trial procedures 
and/or data, without violating the confidentiality of the subject,  to the extent permitted by the 
applicable laws and regulations and that, by signing a written informed consent form, the subject 
or the subject's legally acceptable representative is authorizing such access.  
o) That records identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by the 
applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made publicl y available. If the results of the trial are 
published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential.

4.8.11.   
Prior to participation in the t rial, the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative should 
receive a copy of the signed and dated written informed consent form and any other written 
information provided to the subjects. During a subject’s participation in the trial, the subject or the 
subject’s legally acceptable  representative  should  receive  a copy of the signed  and dated consent  form 
updates  and a copy of any amendments  to the written information provided to subjects.  
4.8.12.   
When a clinical trial (therapeutic or non -therapeut ic) includes subjects who can only be enrolled in the 
trial with the consent of the subject’s legally acceptable representative (e.g., minors, or patients with

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 27/68 
 
 severe dementia), the subject should be informed about the trial to the extent compatible with t he 
subject’s understanding and, if capable, the subject should sign and personally date the written 
informed consent.  
4.8.13.   
Except as described in 4.8.14, a non -therapeutic trial (i.e. a trial in which there is no anticipated direct 
clinical benefit to the subj ect), should be conducted in subjects who personally give consent and who 
sign and date the written informed consent form.  
4.8.14.   
Non-therapeutic trials may be conducted in subjects with consent of a legally acceptable representative 
provided the following condi tions are fulfilled:  
a) The objectives of the trial cannot  be met by means of a trial in subjects who can give informed 
consent personally.  
b) The foreseeable risks to the subjects are low.  
c) The negative impact on the subject’s well -being is minimized and low. (d ) The trial is not 
prohibited by law.  
d) The approval/favourable opinion of the IRB/IEC is expressly sought on the inclusion of such 
subjects, and the written approval/ favourable opinion covers this aspect.  
Such trials, unless an exception is justified, shou ld be conducted in patients having a disease or 
condition for which the investigational product is intended. Subjects in these trials should be 
particularly closely monitored and should be withdrawn if they appear to be unduly distressed.  
4.8.15.   
In emergency sit uations, when prior consent of the subject is not possible, the consent of the subject's 
legally acceptable representative, if present, should be requested. When prior consent of the subject is 
not possible, and the subject’s legally acceptable representat ive is not available, enrolment of the 
subject should require measures described in the protocol and/or elsewhere, with documented 
approval/favourable opinion by the IRB/IEC, to protect the rights, safety and well -being of the subject 
and to ensure complia nce with applicable regulatory requirements. The subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative should be informed about the trial as soon as possible and consent to 
continue and other consent as appropriate (see 4.8.10) should be requested.  
4.9.  Records and Reports  
ADDENDUM  
4.9.0.   
The investigator/institution should maintain adequate an d accurate source documents and trial records 
that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects.  Source data should be 
attributable, legible, con temporaneous, original, accurate, and  complete. Changes to source data 
should be traceable, should not obscure the original  entry, and should be explained if necessary (e.g.,

 4.9.1.   
The investigator should  ensure  the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported to the sponsor in the CRFs and in all required reports.  
4.9.2.   
Data reported on the CRF, that are derived from source documents, should be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies should be explain ed. 
4.9.3.   
Any change or correction to a CRF should be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should 
not obscure the original entry (i.e. an audit trail should be maintained); this applies to both written 
and electronic changes or corrections (see 5. 18.4 (n)). Sponsors should provide g uidance to 
investigators and/or the investigators' designated representatives on making such corrections. 
Sponsors should have written procedures to assure that changes or corrections in CRFs made by 
sponsor's designated  representatives are documented, are necessary, and are endorsed by the 
investigator. The investigator should retain records of the changes and corrections.  
4.9.4.   
The investigator/institution should maintain the trial documents as specified in Essential Documen ts for 
the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (see 8.) and as required  by the applicable  regulatory requirement(s).

The investigator should promptly provide written reports to the sponsor, the IRB/IEC (see 3.3.8) and, 
where applicable, the institution on any changes significantly affecting the conduct of the tria l, and/or 
increasing the risk to subjects.  
4.11.  Safety Reporting  
4.11.1.   
All serious adverse  events (SAEs) should be reported immediately  to the  sponsor except for those 
SAEs that the protocol or other document (e.g., Investigator's Brochure) identifies as not needing  
immediate reporting. The immediate reports should be followed promptly by detailed, written reports. 
The immediate and follow -up reports should identify subjects by unique code numbers assigned to the 
trial subjects rather than by the subjects' names, per sonal identification numbers, and/or addresses. 
The investigator should also comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) related to the 
reporting of unexpected serious adverse drug reactions to the regulatory authority(ies) and the 
IRB/IEC.  
4.11.2.   
Adver se events and/or laboratory abnormalities identified in the protocol as critical to safety 
evaluations should be reported to the sponsor according to the reporting requirements and within the 
time periods specified by the sponsor in the protocol.

5.  Sponsor  
ADDENDUM  
5.0.  Quality m anagement  
The sponsor should implement a system to manage quality throughout  all stages of the trial process.  
Sponsors should focus on trial activities essential to ensuring human subject protection and the  
reliability of trial results. Quality management includes the design of efficient clinical trial  protocols and 
tools and procedures for data collection and processing, as well as the collection of  information that is 
essential to decision making.   
The methods used to assure and control the quality of the trial should be proportionate to the  risks 
inherent in the trial and the importance of the information collected. The sponsor should  ensure that all 
aspects of the trial are operationally feasible and should avoid unne cessary  complexity, procedures, 
and data collection. Protocols, case report forms, and other operational  documents should be clear, 
concise, and consistent.  
The quality management system should use a risk -based approach as described below.  
5.0.1.  Critical process  and data i dentification  
During protocol development, the sponsor should identif y those processes and data that are critical to 
ensure human subject protection and the reliability of trial results.  
5.0.2.  Risk i dentification  
The sponsor should identify risks to c ritical trial proc esses and data. Risks should be considered at both 
the system level (e.g., standard operating procedures, computerized  systems, personnel) and clinical 
trial level (e.g., trial design, data collection, informed  consent process).

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 31/68 
 
 5.0.3.  Risk e valuation  
The sponsor should evaluate the identified risks, ag ainst existing risk controls by considering:  
a) The likelihood of errors occurring.  
b) The extent to which such errors would be detectable.  
c) The impact of such errors on human subject protection and relia bility of trial results.  
5.0.4.  Risk c ontrol  
The sponsor should decide which risks to reduce an d/or which risks to accept. The approach used to 
reduce risk to an acceptable level should be proportionate to the  significance of the risk. Risk reduction 
activities m ay be incorporated in protocol design  and implementation, monitoring plans, agreements 
between parties defining roles and  responsibilities, systematic safeguards to ensure adherence to 
standard operating  procedures, and training in processes and procedures . 
Predefined quality tolerance limits should be established , taking into consideration the medical and 
statistical characteristics of the variables as well as the statistical design of  the trial, to identify 
systematic issues that can impact subject safety  or reliability of trial  results. Detection of deviations 
from the predefined quality tolerance limits should  trigger an evaluation to determine if action is 
needed.  
5.0.5.  Risk c ommunication  
The sponsor should document quality management  activities. The sponsor should communicate quality 
management activities to those who are involved in or affected by  such activities, to facilitate risk 
review and continual improvement during clinical trial  execution.  
5.0.6.  Risk r eview  
The sponsor should periodically review risk contr ol me asures to ascertain whether the implemented 
quality management activities remain effective and relevant, taking into  account emerging knowledge 
and experience.  
5.0.7.  Risk r eporting  
The sponsor should describe the quality management ap proach implemented in t he trial and 
summarize important deviations from the predefined quality tolerance limits and  remedial actions 
taken in the clinical study report (ICH E3, Section 9.6 Data Quality  Assurance).  
5.1.  Quality assurance and quality c ontrol  
5.1.1.

(see 1.21) to all trial related sites, source data/documents , and reports for the purpose of monitoring 
and auditing by th e sponsor, and inspection by domestic and foreign regulatory authorities.  
5.1.3.   
Quality control should be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and 
have been processed correctly.  
5.1.4.   
Agreements, made by the sponsor with the in vestigator/institution and any other parties involved with 
the clinical trial, should be in writing, as part of the protocol or in a separate agreement.  
5.2.  Contract Research Organization (CRO)  
5.2.1.   
A sponsor may transfer any or all of the sponsor's trial -related duties and functions to a CRO, but the 
ultimate responsibility for the quality and integrity of the trial data always resides with the sponsor. 
The CRO should implement quality assurance and quality control.  
5.2.2.   
Any trial -related duty and function that is tra nsferred to and assumed by a  CRO should be specified in 
writing.   
ADDENDUM  
The sponsor should ensure oversight of any trial -related d uties and functions carried out on its behalf, 
including trial -related duties and functions that are subcontracted to anoth er party by the sponsor’s 
contracted CRO(s).  
5.2.3.   
Any trial-related  duties  and functions  not specifically  transferred  to and assumed by a CRO are 
retained by the sponsor.  
5.2.4.   
All references to a sponsor in this guideline also apply to a CRO to the extent that a C RO has assumed 
the trial related duties and functions of a sponsor.  
5.3.  Medical e xpertise  
The sponsor should designate appropriately qualified medical personnel who will be readily  available  to 
advise  on trial related  medical  questions  or problems.  If necessar y, outside consultant(s) may be 
appointed for this purpose.

trial, to handle the data, to verify the data, to conduct the statistical analy ses, and to prepare the trial 
reports. 
5.5.2. 
The sponsor may consider establishing an independent data-monitoring committee (IDMC ) to assess 
the progre ss of a clinical trial, including the safety dat a and the critical efficacy endpoint s at intervals, 
and to recommend to the sponsor whether to continue, modify, or stop a trial. The IDMC should have 
written operating procedures and maintain written records  of all its meetings. 
5.5.3. 
When using electroni c trial data handling and/o r remote electroni c trial dat a systems, the sponsor 
should: 
a)Ensure and document that the electronic data processing system(s) conforms to the sponsor’s
established requirements for completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistent intended
performance (i.e. validation).
ADDENDUM 
The sponsor should base their approach to validation of such systems on a risk assessment that takes 
into consideration the intended use of the system and the potential of the system to affect human 
subject protection and reliability of trial results. 
b)Maintains SOPs for using these systems.
ADDENDUM 
The SOPs should cover system setup, installation, and use. The SOPs should describe system 
validation and functionality testing, data collection and handling, system maintenance, system security 
measures, change control, data backup, recovery, contingency planning, and decommissioning. The 
responsibilities of the sponsor, investigator, and other parties with respect to the use of these 
computerized systems should be clear, and the users should be provided with training in their use.

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 34/68 
 
 c) Ensure that the systems are designed to permit data changes in such a way that the data changes 
are documented and that there is no deletion of entered data (i.e. maintain an audit trail, data 
trail, edit trail).  
d) Maintain a security system that prevents unauth orized access to the data.  
e) Maintain a list of the individuals who are authorized to make data changes (see 4.1.5 and 4.9.3).  
f) Maintain adequate backup of the data.  
g) Safeguard the blinding, i f any (e.g. maintain the blinding during data entry and processing).  
ADDENDUM  
h) Ensure the integrity of the data including any data that describe the context, content, and 
structure. This is particularly important when making changes to the computerized syst ems, such 
as software upgrades or migration of data.  
5.5.4.   
If data are transformed during processing, it should always be possible to compare the original data 
and observations with the processed data.  
5.5.5.   
The sponsor should use an unambiguous subject identificati on code (see 1.58)  that allows identification 
of all the data reported for each subject.  
5.5.6.   
The sponsor, or other owners of the data, should retain all of the sponsor - specific   essential  
documents pertaining to  the trial (see 8.  Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial).  
5.5.7.   
The sponsor should retain all sponsor -specific essential documents in conformance with the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s) of the country(ies) where the product is approved, and/or where the 
sponsor intends to apply for approval(s).  
5.5.8.   
If the  sponsor  discontinues the  clinical  development of  an investigational product (i.e. for any or all 
indications, routes of administration, or dosage forms), the sponsor should maintain all sponsor -
specific essential documents for at least  2 years after formal discontinuation or in conformance with 
the applicable regulatory  requirement(s).  
5.5.9.   
If the sponsor  discontinues the  clinical  development of  an investigational product, the sponsor should

course of clinical development, the results of any additional studies of the formulated product(s) (e.g. 
stability, dissolution rate,  bioavailability)  needed  to assess  whether  these  changes  would significantly 
alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the product should be available prior to the use of the new 
formulation in clinical trials.  
5.14.  Supplying and handling investigational p roduct(s)  
5.14.1.   
The sponsor is responsible for sup plying the investigator(s)/institution(s) with the investigational 
product(s).  
5.14.2.   
The sponsor  should  not supply  an investigator/institution  with the investigational product(s) until the 
sponsor obtains all required documentation (e.g. approval/favourable opi nion from IRB/IEC and 
regulatory authority(ies)).  
5.14.3.   
The sponsor should ensure that written procedures include instructions that the investigator/institution 
should follow for the handling and storage of investigational product(s) for the trial and documenta tion 
thereof. The procedures should address adequate and safe receipt, handling, storage, dispensing, 
retrieval of unused product from subjects, and return of unused investigational  product(s)  to the 
sponsor  (or alternative  disposition  if authorized by the  sponsor and in compliance with the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s)).  
5.14.4.   
The sponsor should:  
a) Ensure timely delivery of investigational product(s) to the investigator(s).  
b) Maintain records that document shipment, re ceipt, disposition, return, and destruc tion of the 
investigational product(s) (see 8. Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial).  
c) Maintain  a system  for retrieving  investigational  products  and documenting this retrieval (e.g. for 
deficient product recall, reclaim after trial comple tion, expired product reclaim).

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 39/68 
 
 d) Maintain a system for the disposition of unused investigational product(s)  and for the 
documentation of this disposition.  
5.14.5.   
The sponsor should:  
a) Take steps to ensure that the investigational product(s) are stable over the peri od of use.  
b) Maintain sufficient quantities of the investigational product(s) used in the trials to reconfirm 
specifications, should this become necessary, and maintain records of batch sample analyses and 
characteristics. To the extent stability permits, sa mples should be retained either until the analyses 
of the trial data are complete or as required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s), 
whichever represents the longer retention period.  
5.15.  Record a ccess  
5.15.1.   
The sponsor should ensure that it is specified in  the protocol or other written agreement that the 
investigator(s)/institution(s) provide direct access to source data/documents for trial -related 
monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection.  
5.15.2.   
The sponsor should verify that each subject ha s consented, in writing, to direct access to his/her 
original medical records for trial -related monitoring, audit, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection.  
5.16.  Safety i nformation  
5.16.1.   
The sponsor  is responsible  for the ongoing  safety  evaluation  of the investigat ional product(s).  
5.16.2.   
The sponsor should promptly notify all concerned investigator(s)/institution(s)  and the regulatory 
authority(ies) of findings that could affect adversely the  safety of  subjects, impact the  conduct of  the 
trial, or  alter the IRB/IEC's app roval/favourable opinion to continue the trial.  
5.17.  Adverse drug reaction r eporting  
5.17.1.   
The sponsor  should  expedite  the reporting  to all concerned investigator(s)/institutions(s), to the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s), where required, and to the regulatory authority(ies) of all a dverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) that are both serious and unexpected.

Guideline for good clinical practice E6 (R2)   
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 40/68 
 
 5.17.2.   
Such expedited  reports  should  comply  with the applicable  regulatory requirement(s) and with the ICH 
Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited R eporting.  
5.17.3.   
The sponsor should submit to the regulatory authority(ies) all safety updates and periodic reports, as 
required by applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
5.18.  Monitoring  
5.18.1.  Purpose  
The purposes of trial monitoring are to verify that:  
a) The rights and well -being of human subjects are protected.  
b) The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
c) The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with 
GCP, and with the applicable regu latory requirement(s).  
5.18.2.  Selection and qualifications of m onitors  
a) Monitors should be appointed by the sponsor.  
b) Monitors should be appropriately trained, and should have the scientific and/or clinical knowledge 
needed to monitor the trial adequately. A monito r’s qualifications should be documented.  
c) Monitors should be thoroughly familiar with the investigational product(s), the protocol, written 
informed consent form and any other written information to be provided to subjects, the sponsor’s 
SOPs, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
5.18.3.  Extent and nature of m onitoring  
The sponsor should ensure that the trials are adequately monitored. The sponsor should determine the 
appropriate extent and nature of monitoring. The determination of the extent and natu re of monitoring 
should be based on considerations such as the objective, purpose, design, complexity, blinding, size,  
and endpoints  of the trial. In general  there  is a need for on-site monitoring, before, during, and after 
the trial; however in exceptiona l circumstances the sponsor may determine that central monitoring in 
conjunction with procedures such as investigators’ training and meetings, and extensive written 
guidance can assure appropriate conduct of the trial in accordance with GCP. Statistically controlled 
sampling may be an acceptable method for selecting the data to be verified.  
ADDENDUM  
The sponsor should develop a systematic, prioritized, risk -based ap proach to monitoring clinical trials. 
The flexibility in the extent and nature of monitoring described in this  section is intended to permit 
varied approaches that improve the effectiveness and  efficiency of monitoring. The sponsor may 
choose on -site monitoring, a combination of  on-site and centralized monitoring, or, where justified, 
centralized monitoring. The  sponsor should document the rationale for the chosen monitoring strategy 
(e.g., in the  monitoring plan).

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 41/68 
 
 On-site monitoring is performed at the sites at which the cli nical trial is being conducted. Centralized 
monitoring is a remote evaluat ion of accumulating data, performed in a  timely manner, supported by 
appropriately qualified and trained persons (e.g., data  managers, biostatisticians).  
Centralized monitoring processes provide additional m onitoring capabilities that can complement and 
reduce the extent and/or frequency of on -site monitoring and help  distinguish between reliable data 
and potentially unreliable data.  
Review,  that may include statistical analyses, of acc umulating data from centralized monitoring can be 
used to:  
a) identify miss ing data, inconsistent data, data outliers, unexpected lack of variability and protocol 
deviations.  
b) examine data trends such as the range, consistency, and variability of data within and across sites.  
c) evaluate for systematic or significant errors in data c ollection and reporting at a site or across 
sites; or potential data manipulation or data integrity problems.  
d) analyze site characteristics and performance metrics.  
e) select sites and/or processes for targeted on -site monitoring.  
5.18.4.  Monitor's r esponsibilities  
The monitor(s) in accordance with the sponsor’s requirements should ensure that the trial is conducted 
and documented properly by carrying out the following activities when relevant and necessary to the 
trial and the trial site:  
a) Acting as the main line of co mmunication between the sponsor and the investigator.  
b) Verifying that the investigator has adequate qualifications and resources (see 4.1, 4.2, 5.6) and 
remain adequate throughout the trial period, that facilities, including laboratories, equipment, and 
staff, are adequate to safely and properly conduct the trial and remain adequate throughout the 
trial period.  
c) Verifying, for the investigational product(s):  
i. That storage times and conditions are acceptable, and that supplies are sufficient throughout 
the tria l. 
ii. That the investigational product(s) are supplied only to subjects who are eligible to receive it 
and at the protocol specified dose(s).  
iii. That subjects are provided with necessary instruction on properly using,  handling,  
storing,  and returning  the investi gational product(s).  
iv. That the receipt, use, and return of the investigational product(s) at the trial sites are 
controlled and documented adequately.  
v. That the disposition of unused investigational product(s) at the trial sites complies with 
applicable regu latory requirement(s) and is in accordance with the sponsor.  
d) Verifying that the investigator follows the approved protocol and all approved amendment(s), if 
any.

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 42/68 
 
 e) Verifying that written informed consent was obtained before each subject's participation in th e 
trial. 
f) Ensuring  that the investigator  receives  the current  Investigator's Brochure, all documents, and all 
trial supplies needed to conduct the trial properly and to comply with the applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).  
g) Ensuring that the investigator and  the investigator's trial staff are adequately informed about the 
trial. 
h) Verifying that the investigator and the investigator's trial staff are performing the specified trial 
functions, in accordance with the protocol and  any other  written  agreement  betwee n the 
sponsor  and the investigator/institution, and have not delegated these functions to unauthorized 
individuals.  
i) Verifying that the investigator is enroling only eligible subjects.  
j) Reporting the subject recruitment rate.  
k) Verifying that source documents  and other trial records are accurate, complete, kept up -to-date 
and maintained.  
l) Verifying  that the investigator  provides  all the required  reports, notifications, applications, and 
submissions, and that these documents are accurate, complete, timely, legib le, dated, and identify 
the trial.  
m) Checking  the accuracy  and completeness  of the CRF entries,  source documents and other trial -
related records against each other. The monitor specifically should verify that:  
i. The data required by the protocol  are reported a ccurately on the CRFs and are consistent with 
the source documents.  
ii. Any dose and/or therapy modifications are well documented for each of the trial subjects.  
iii. Adverse events, concomitant medications and intercurrent illnesses are reported in accordance 
with the protocol on the CRFs.  
iv. Visits that the subjects fail to make, tests that are not conducted, and examinations that are 
not performed are clearly reported as such on the CRFs.  
v. All withdrawals and dropouts of enrolled subjects from the trial are reported and explained on 
the CRFs.  
n) Informing the investigator of any CRF entry error, omission, or illegibility. The monitor should 
ensure that appropriate corrections, additions, or deletions are made, dated, explained (if 
necessary), and initialled by the investi gator or by a member of the investigator's trial staff who is 
authorized to initial CRF changes for the investigator. This authorization should be documented.  
o) Determining whether all adverse events (AEs) are appropriately reported within the time periods 
required by GCP, the protocol, the IRB/IEC, the sponsor, and the applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).  
p) Determining whether the investigator is maintaining the essential documents (see 8. Essential 
Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial).

Guideline f or good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 43/68 
 
 q) Communicatin g deviations  from the protocol,  SOPs,  GCP, and the applicable  regulatory  
requirements  to the investigator  and taking appropriate action designed to prevent recurrence of 
the detected deviations.  
5.18.5.  Monitoring p rocedures  
The monitor(s) should follow the sponso r’s established written SOPs as well as those procedures that 
are specified by the sponsor for monitoring a specific trial.  
5.18.6.  Monitoring r eport  
a) The monitor should submit a written report to the sponsor after each trial - site visit or trial -related 
communicat ion. 
b) Reports should include the date, site, name of the monitor, and name of the investigator or other 
individual(s) contacted.  
c) Reports should include a summary of what the monitor reviewed and the monitor's statements 
concerning the significant findings/f acts, deviations and deficiencies, conclusions, actions taken or 
to be taken and/or actions recommended to secure compliance.  
d) The review and follow -up of the monitoring report with the sponsor should be documented by the 
sponsor’s designated representative . 
ADDENDUM  
e) Reports of on -site and/or centralized monitoring should be provided to the sponsor (including 
appropriate management and staff responsible for trial and site oversight) in a timely manner for 
review and follow up. Results of monitoring activitie s should be documented in sufficient detail to 
allow verification of compliance with the monitoring plan. Reporting of centralized monitoring 
activities should be regular and may be independent from site visits.  
ADDENDUM  
5.18.7.  Monitoring p lan 
The sponsor should develop a monitoring plan that is  tailored to the specific human subject protection 
and data integrity risks of the trial. The plan should describe the  monitoring strategy, the monitoring 
responsibilities of all the parties involved, the  various monitoring  methods to be used, and the 
rationale for their use. The plan should  also emphasize the monitoring of critical data and processes. 
Particular attention  should be given to those aspects that are not routine clinical practice and that 
require  additional tra ining. The monitoring plan should reference the applicable policies and  
procedures.  
5.19.  Audit  
If or when sponsors perform audits, as part of implementing quality assurance, they should consider:  
5.19.1.  Purpose  
The purpose of a sponsor's audit, which is independent of  and separate from routine monitoring or 
quality control functions, should be to evaluate trial conduct and compliance with the protocol, SOPs, 
GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements.

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 44/68 
 
 5.19.2.  Selection and qualification of a uditors  
a) The sponsor  should  appoint individuals,  who are independent  of the clinical trials/systems, to 
conduct audits.  
b) The sponsor should ensure that the auditors are qualified by training and experience to conduct 
audits properly. An auditor’s qualifications should be documented.  
5.19.3.  Audit ing p rocedures  
a) The sponsor should ensure that the auditing of clinical trials/systems is conducted in accordance 
with the sponsor's written procedures on what to audit, how to audit, the frequency of audits, and 
the form and content of audit reports.  
b) The s ponsor's audit plan and procedures for a trial audit should be guided by the importance of the 
trial to submissions to regulatory authorities, the number of subjects in the trial, the type and 
complexity of the trial, the level of risks to the trial subjec ts, and any identified problem(s).  
c) The observations and findings of the auditor(s) should be documented.  
d) To preserve  the independence  and value  of the audit function,  the regulatory authority(ies) should 
not routinely request the audit reports. Regulatory authority(ies) may seek access to an audit 
report on a case by case basis when evidence of serious GCP non -compliance exists, or in the 
course of legal proceedings.  
e) When required by applicable law or regulation, the sponsor should provide an audit certific ate. 
5.20.  Noncompliance  
5.20.1.   
Noncompliance with the protocol, SOPs, GCP, and/or applicable regulatory requirement(s) by an 
investigator/institution, or by member(s) of the sponsor's staff should lead to prompt action by the 
sponsor to secure compliance.  
ADDENDUM  
If noncompliance that significantly affects or has the po tential to significantly affect human subject 
protection or reliability of trial results is discovered, the sponsor should  perform a root cause analysis 
and implement appropriate corrective and prevent ive actions.  
5.20.2.   
If the monitoring  and/or  auditing  identifies  serious  and/or  persistent noncompliance on the part of an 
investigator/institution, the sponsor should terminate the investigator's/institution’s participation in the 
trial. When an investigator's/ institution’s  participation   is  terminated   because   of 
noncompliance,  the sponsor  should  notify  promptly  the regulatory authority(ies).  
5.21.  Premature t ermination or  suspension of a t rial 
If a trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor should p romptly inform the 
investigators/institutions, and the regulatory authority(ies) of the termination or suspension and the 
reason(s) for the termination or suspension. The IRB/IEC should also be informed promptly and

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 45/68 
 
 provided the reason(s) for the terminati on or susp ension by the sponsor or by the investigator  / 
institution, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
5.22.  Clinical trial/study r eports  
Whether the trial is completed or prematurely terminated, the sponsor should ensure that the clinic al 
trial reports are prepared and provided to the regulatory agency(ies) as required by the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s). The sponsor should also ensure that the clinical trial reports in marketing 
applications meet the standards of the ICH Guideli ne for Structure and Content of Clinical Study 
Reports. (NOTE: The ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports specifies that 
abbreviated study reports may be acceptable in certain cases.)  
5.23.  Multicentre t rials 
For multicentre trials, th e sponsor should ensure that:  
5.23.1.   
All investigators conduct the trial in strict compliance with the protocol agreed to by the sponsor and, if 
required, by the regulatory authority(ies), and given approval/favourable opinion by the IRB/IEC.  
5.23.2.   
The CRFs are desig ned to capture the required data at all multicentre trial sites. For those investigators 
who are collecting additional data, supplemental CRFs should also be provided that are designed to 
capture the additional data.  
5.23.3.   
The responsibilities of coordinating i nvestigator(s) and the other participating investigators are 
documented prior to the start of the trial.  
5.23.4.   
All investigators are given instructions on following the protocol, on complying with a uniform set of 
standards for the assessment of clinical and la boratory findings, and on completing the CRFs.  
5.23.5.   
Communication between investigators is facilitated.

 7.  Investigator’ s brochure  
7.1.  Introduction  
The Investigator's Brochure (IB) is a compilation of the clinical and nonclinical data on the 
investigational product(s) that are relevant to the study of the p roduct(s) in human subjects. Its 
purpose is to provide the investigators and others involved in the trial with the information to facilitate 
their understanding of the rationale for, and their compliance with, many key features of the protocol, 
such as the  dose, dose frequency/interval, methods of administration: and safety monitoring 
procedures. The IB also provides insight to support the clinical management of the study subjects 
during the course of the clinical trial. The information should be presented in a concise,  simple,  
objective,  balanced,  and non-promotional  form that enables  a clinician, or potential investigator, to 
understand it and make his/her own unbiased risk -benefit assessment of the appropriateness of the 
proposed trial. For this reason, a  medically qualified person should generally participate in the editing 
of an IB, but the contents of the IB should be approved by the disciplines tha t generated the described 
data. 
This guideline delineates the minimum information that should be included in an IB and provides 
suggestions for its layout. It is expected that the type and extent of information available will vary with 
the stage of development of the investigational product. If the investigational product is marketed and 
its pharmacology is wi dely understood by medical practitioners, an extensive IB may not be necessary. 
Where permitted by regulatory authorities, a basic product information brochure, package leaflet, or 
labelling may be an appropriate alternative, provided that it includes curr ent, comprehensive, and 
detailed information on all aspects of the investigational product that might be of importance to the 
investigator. If a marketed product is being studied for a new use (i.e., a new indication), an IB 
specific to that new use should  be prepared. The IB should be reviewed at least annually and revised 
as necessary in compliance with a sponsor's written procedures. More frequent revision may be 
appropriate depending on the stage of development and the generation of relevant new informa tion. 
However, in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, relevant new information may be so important that 
it should be communicated to the investigators, and possibly to the Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) and/or r egulatory authorities before it is included in a 
revised IB.  
Generally, the sponsor is responsible for ensuring that an up -to-date IB is made available to the 
investigator(s) and the investigators are responsible for providing the up -to-date IB to the resp onsible 
IRBs/IECs. In the case of an investigator sponsored trial, the sponsor -investigator should determine 
whether a brochure is available from the commercial manufacturer. If the investigational product is 
provided by the sponsor -investigator, then he o r she should provide the necessary information to the 
trial personnel. In cases where preparation of a formal IB is impractical, the sponsor - investigator 
should provide, as a substitute, an expanded background information section in the trial protocol tha t 
contains the minimum current information described in this guideline.  
7.2.  General c onsiderations  
The IB should include:  
7.2.1.  Title p age 
This should provide the sponsor's name, the identity of each investigational product (i.e., research 
number, chemical or approv ed generic name, and trade name(s) where legally permissible and desired

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 53/68 
 
 by the sponsor), and the release date. It is also suggested that an edition number, and a reference to 
the number and date of the edition it supersedes, be provided. An example is giv en in Appendix 1.  
7.2.2.  Confidentiality s tatement  
The sponsor may wish to include a statement instructing the investigator/recipients to treat the IB as a 
confidential document for the sole information and use of the investigator's team and the IRB/IEC.  
7.3.  Contents  of the investigator’s b rochure  
The IB should contain the following sections, each with literature references where appropriate:  
7.3.1.  Table of c ontents  
An example of the Table of Contents is given in Appendix 2  
7.3.2.  Summary  
A brief summary (preferably not exceeding two pages) should be given, highlighting the significant 
physical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pharmacological, toxicological, pharmacokinetic, metabolic, and 
clinical information available that is relevant to the stage of clinical development of the investi gational 
product.  
7.3.3.  Introduction  
A brief introductory statement should be provided that contains the chemical name (and generic and 
trade name(s) when approved) of the investigational product(s), all active ingredients, the 
investigational product (s ) pharm acological class and its expected position within this class (e.g. 
advantages), the rationale for performing research with the investigational product(s), and the 
anticipated prophylactic, therapeutic, or diagnostic indication(s). Finally, the introductory  statement 
should provide the general approach to be followed in evaluating the investigational product.  
7.3.4.  Physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical p roperties and f ormulation  
A description should be provided of the investigational product substance(s) (includi ng the chemical 
and/or structural formula(e)), and a brief summary should be given of the relevant physical, chemical, 
and pharmaceutical propertie s. 
To permit appropriate safety measures to be taken in the course of the trial, a description of the 
formula tion(s) to be used, including excipients, should be provided and justified if clinically relevant. 
Instructions for the storage and handling of the dosage form(s) should also be given.  
Any structural similarities to other known compounds should be mentione d. 
7.3.5.  Nonclinical s tudies  
Introduction:  
The results of all relevant nonclinical pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetic, and investigational 
product metabolism studies should be provided in summary form. This summary should address the 
methodology used, the  results, and a discussion of the relevance of the findings to the investigated 
therapeutic and the possible unfavourable and unintended effects in humans.

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)

  The information  provided  may include  the following,  as appropriate,  if known/available:  
 Species test ed 
 Number and sex of animals in each group  
 Unit dose (e.g., milligram/kilogram (mg/kg))  
 Dose interval  
 Route of administration  
 Duration of dosing  
 Information on systemic distribution

 Severity or intensity of pharmacological or toxic effects  
 Time to onset of effects  
 Reversibility of effects  
 Duration of effects  
 Dose response  
Tabular  format/listings should  be used whenever  possible to enhance  the clarity of the presentation.  
The following sections should discuss the most important findings from the studies, including the dose 
response of observed effects, the relevance to humans, and any aspects to be studied in humans. If 
applic able, the effective and nontoxic dose findings in the same animal species should be compared 
(i.e., the therapeutic index should be discussed). The relevance of this information to the proposed 
human dosing should be addressed. Whenever possible, compariso ns should be made in terms of 
blood/tissue levels rather than on a mg/kg basis.  
a) Nonclinical p harmacology  
A summary of the pharmacological aspects of the investigational product and, where appropriate, its 
significant metabolites studied in animals, should  be included.  Such a summary  should  incorporate  
studies  that assess potential therapeutic activity (e.g. efficacy models, receptor binding, and 
specificity) as well as those that assess safety (e.g., special studies to assess pharmacological actions 
other t han the intended therapeutic effect(s)).  
b) Pharmacokinetics and product metabolism in a nimals  
A summary of the pharmacokinetics and biological transformation and disposition of the investigational 
product in all species studied should be given. The discussio n of the findings should address the 
absorption and the local and systemic bioavailability of the investigational product and its metabolites,  
and their relationship  to the pharmacological  and toxicological findings in animal species.  
c) Toxicology  
A summary of the toxicological effects found in relevant studies conducted in different animal species 
should be described under the following headings where appropriate:

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 55/68 
 
  Single dose  
 Repeated dose  
 Carcinogenicity  
 Special studies (e.g. irritancy and sensitisation)  
 Reproductive toxicity  
 Genotoxicity (mutagenicity)  
7.3.6.  Effects in h umans  
Introduction:  
A thorough discussion of the known effects of the investigational product(s) in humans should be 
provided, including information on pharmacokinetics, metabolism, pharmacodynami cs, dose response, 
safety, efficacy, and other pharmacological activities. Where possible, a summary of each completed 
clinical  trial should  be provided.  Information  should  also be provided regarding results of any use of 
the investigational product(s) oth er than from in clinical trials, such as from experience during 
marketing.  
a) Pharmacokine tics and product metabolism in h umans  
 A summary  of information  on the pharmacokinetics  of the investigational product(s) should be 
presented, including the following, if  available:  
 Pharmacokinetics  (including  metabolism,  as appropriate,  and absorption, plasma protein binding, 
distribution, and elimination).  
 Bioavailability of the investigational product (absolute, where possible, and/or relative) using a 
reference dosage form.  
 Population subgroups (e.g., gender, age, and impaired organ function).  
 Interactions (e.g., product -product interactions and effects of food).  
 Other  pharmacokinetic  data (e.g.,  results  of population  studies performed within clinical trial(s).  
b) Safety a nd efficacy  
A summary of information should be provided about the investigational product's/products' (including 
metabolites, where appropriate) safety, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and dose response that were 
obtained from preceding trials in humans (healt hy volunteers and/or patients). The implications of this 
information should be discussed. In cases where a number of clinical trials have been completed, the 
use of summaries of safety and efficacy across multiple trials by indications in subgroups may pro vide 
a clear presentation of the data. Tabular summaries of adverse drug reactions for all the clinical trials 
(including those for all the studied indications)  would  be useful.  Important  differences  in adverse  drug 
reaction patterns/incidences across indi cations or subgroups should be discussed.  
The IB should provide a description of the possible risks and adverse drug reactions to be anticipated 
on the basis of prior experiences with the product  under  investigation  and with related  products.  A 
description  should also be provided of the precautions or special monitoring to be done as part of the 
investigational use of the product(s).  
c) Marketing e xperience

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 56/68 
 
 The IB should identify countries where the investigational product has been marketed or approved. 
Any si gnificant information arising from the marketed use should be summarised (e.g., formulations, 
dosages, routes of administration, and adverse product reactions). The IB should also identify all the 
countries where the investigational product did not receive  approval/registration for marketing or was 
withdrawn from marketing/registration.  
7.3.7.  Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator  
This section should provide an overall discussion of the nonclinical and clinical data, and should 
summarise the informatio n from various sources on different aspects of the investigational product(s), 
wherever possible. In this way, the investigator can be provided with the most informative 
interpretation of the available data and with an assessment of the implications of the  information for 
future clinical trials.  
Where appropriate, the published reports on related products should be discussed. This could help the 
investigator to anticipate adverse drug reactions or other problems in clinical trials.  
The overall aim of this s ection is to provide the investigator with a clear understanding  of 
the possible  risks  and adverse  reactions,  and of the specific  tests,  observations,  and 
precautions  that may be needed  for a clinical trial. This understanding should be based on 
the availa ble physical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical 
information on the investigational product(s). Guidance should also be provided to the 
clinical investigator on the recognition and treatment of possible overdose and adve rse drug 
reactions that is based on previous human experience and on the pharmacology of the 
investigational product.

 8.  Essential documents for the conduct of a clinical trial  
8.1.  Introduction  
Essential Documents are those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and t he quality o f the data produced. 
These documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the investigator, sponsor and monitor with the standards of Good Clini cal Practice and with all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
Essential Documents also serve a number of other  important purposes. Filing essential documents at the investigator/institution and sponsor sites in a 
timely manner can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial by the investigator, sponsor and monitor. These docu ments are also the ones whic h 
are usually audited by the sponsor's independent audit function and inspected by the regulatory authority(ies) as part of the  process to confirm the validity 
of the trial conduct and the integrity of data collected.  
The minimum list of essential document s which has been developed follows. The various documents are grouped in three sections according to the stage of 
the trial during which they will normally be generated: 1) before the clinical phase of the trial commences, 2) during the cl inical conduct of  the trial, and 3) 
after completion or termination of the trial. A description is given of the purpose of each document, and whether it should b e filed in either the 
investigator/institution or sponsor files, or both. It is acceptable to combine some of th e documents, provided the individual elements are readily identifiable.  
Trial master files should be established at the beginning of the trial, both at the investigator/institution’s site and at th e sponsor's office. A final close -out of 
a trial can only b e done when the monitor has reviewed both investigator/institution and sponsor files and confirmed that all necessary documen ts are in the 
appropriate files.  
Any or all of the documents addressed in this guideline may be subject to, and should be available  for, audit by the sponsor’s auditor and inspection by the 
regulatory authority(ies).  
ADDENDUM  
The sponsor and investigator/institution should maintain a record of the location(s) of their respective essen tial documents including source documents. The 
storage system used during the trial and for archiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for document  identification, version history, 
search, and retrieval.  
Essential documents for the trial should be supplemented or may be reduced where  justified (in advance of  trial initiation) based on the importance and 
relevance of the specific documents to the trial.

Guideline for good clinical practice E6(R2)    
EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995   Page 60/68 
 
 The sponsor should ensure that the investigator has control of and continuous access to the CRF data reported to the sponsor. The spon sor should not have 
exclusive control of those data.  
When a copy is used to replace an original document (e.g., source documents, CRF), the copy should fulfill the requirements f or certified copies.  
The investigator/institution should have control of all e ssential documents and records generated by the investiga tor/institution before, during, and after the 
trial. 
8.2.  Before the clinical phase of the trial commences  
During this planning stage the following documents should be generated and should be on file before the trial formally start
